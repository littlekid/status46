Monitoring peoples health by broadcasting the question "Hur m√•r du?" to all mobile phones in a specific area via sms üì≤ once per day.

People can answer with just one word like good, bad, cold, fever or give a more detailed response. They can even reply with an emoji. The data that comes in would be collected to properly visualize how people in the area are feeling, and how that's developing over time. And how the course of the disease ("sjukdomsf√∂rloppet") is for many people. Anyone who replies they're sick can be asked about how they're feeling multiple times per day to get more relevant data. Depending on what you reply you'd either get a thank you  for reporting (if you're feeling :ok_hand::skin-tone-4:), or if you've mentioned fever (:face_with_thermometer:) then you'd get a few follow up questions; do you have any other symptoms? Is there anything you'd like help with? .. if they reply yes, then send them information about all the existing ways/initiatives where they can ask for help (the solution could be developed to ask a few other people in the same area that replied :ok_hand::skin-tone-4: that day, if they're willing to help someone out who lives nearby and is sick today. People that don't wish to be tracked can simply not reply, or clearly answer "stop asking me", and we wouldn't as again.

**Background:** I would be happy to provide data about how I'm feeling, if it was easy to do. I've been sick myself and I'm guessing it was Corona because of the symptoms, and I lacked an easy way to report this and to keep track of the "course of the disease" (sjukdomsf√∂rloppet). 

Option: Automated phone calls. Just like when explosives will be used in an area and you can get an automated phone call informing you of this. "Press 1 to confirm you've received this information, Press 2 if you want to talk to someone". These calls could be: Hej! With the current Corona-crisis we're asking all citizens in this area with many infected if you're willing to start reporting any symptoms, to enable live updates to the situation... 

TODOs:
- [x] landingpage 
- [ ] create a video explaining the solution
- [x] create a demo
  - [x] setup a number
  - [x] setup different flows of what happens next depending on what the reply is

- [ ] refine demo
  - [ ] show examples of how replies can be agregated and visualized
  - [ ] create conditions for how to interpret replies
- [ ] handle integrity issues
- [ ] mobilanpassa info-sidan

Detail: An option would be that people go to status46.se and fill out their phonenumber to start receiving questions each day, but then that would require lots of work on communicating the existance of this setup.
